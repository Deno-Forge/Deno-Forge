Flint is the origin of the Forge—a smith who doesn't merely craft tools, but crafts smiths. He is the silent judge behind every test suite, the architect behind every convention. Where others rush to commit, Flint contemplates. His hammer is law. His silence, legend.

Quill is the youngest of the Deno Smiths, but no less exacting. He records the ways of the Forge, ensures every function passes the trial of flame, and documents each tool as though it were a sacred artifact. Armed with a tiny hammer and an oversized feather quill, he maintains the library of all things forged.
